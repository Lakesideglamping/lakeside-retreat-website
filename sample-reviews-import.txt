Absolutely stunning location! The Pinot Dome exceeded all expectations. Waking up to panoramic views of Lake Dunstan was magical. Sandy was an incredible host - so welcoming and helpful with local recommendations. The dome was spotlessly clean and beautifully decorated. Can't wait to return!

Perfect romantic getaway! The RosÃ© Dome was luxurious and private. The outdoor bath under the stars was unforgettable. Sandy's breakfast provisions were delicious. The vineyard setting is breathtaking. Highly recommend for couples seeking a special escape.

The Lakeside Cottage was exactly what we needed for our family break. Kids loved exploring the property and the proximity to the lake. Sandy went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. Great value and amazing views. Will definitely book again!

Beautiful property with incredible views. The Pinot Dome was comfortable and well-equipped. Only minor issue was the wind one night, but Sandy had warned us and provided extra blankets. Overall a wonderful experience and would recommend.

Wow! What a place! The photos don't do justice to the actual views. Stayed in the RosÃ© Dome and loved every minute. The spa bath, the sunrise, the peace and quiet - everything was perfect. Sandy is a superb host. Already planning our next visit.

Review: "Thank you so much for a wonderful stay at Lakeside Cottage. Our family had an amazing time and the kids are already asking when we can come back! The location is perfect - close enough to Cromwell for supplies but far enough away to feel like a real escape. Sandy was incredibly helpful and accommodating. We'll definitely be recommending you to our friends!"
