# 📧 Contact Form Email Setup

The contact form has been updated with email sending functionality, but you need to configure an email service to actually receive messages.

## 🔍 **Current Status**
- ✅ Contact form is working and receiving submissions
- ✅ Form validation is working  
- ✅ Server logs all contact form submissions
- ❌ **No email delivery configured** (this is why you're not receiving emails)

## 🚀 **Quick Setup Options**

### Option 1: SendGrid (Recommended)
1. Sign up for SendGrid account at https://sendgrid.com
2. Create an API key
3. Add to your `.env` file:
```
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_actual_sendgrid_api_key
FROM_EMAIL=info@lakesideretreat.co.nz
```

### Option 2: Gmail (For Testing)
1. Enable 2-factor authentication on your Gmail
2. Generate an app password
3. Add to your `.env` file:
```
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
```

## 📝 **What the Contact Form Does Now**

### Without Email Configuration:
- ✅ Receives form submissions
- ✅ Validates all fields
- ✅ Shows success message to users
- ✅ Logs messages to server console
- ❌ **Does not send emails**

### With Email Configuration:
- ✅ All of the above, PLUS:
- ✅ **Sends email to info@lakesideretreat.co.nz**
- ✅ Email includes all form details
- ✅ Reply-to is set to sender's email

## 🔧 **How to Enable Email Delivery**

1. **Create `.env` file** (copy from `.env.example`)
2. **Add your email service credentials**  
3. **Restart the server**
4. **Test the contact form**

## ✅ **Email Template Preview**

When configured, emails will look like:

**Subject:** New Contact Form: Booking Inquiry - John Smith

**Body:**
```
New contact form submission from Lakeside Retreat website:

Name: John Smith
Email: john@example.com
Phone: 021-123-4567
Subject: Booking Inquiry
Submitted: 2025-08-24T23:03:00.000Z

Message:

Do you have availability?

```

## 🐛 **Current Fallback**

Until email is configured, **all contact form submissions are logged to the server console**. You can see them by checking the server logs:

```bash
npm start
# Look for lines like:
# 📝 Contact form logged (no email service): John Smith (john@example.com) - Subject: Booking Inquiry
```

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. Choose an email service (SendGrid recommended)
2. Get API credentials
3. Create `.env` file with credentials
4. Restart server
5. Test contact form - you should receive emails!
